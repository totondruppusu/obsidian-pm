# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Optional auto-merge flow for sync conflict copies in shared vaults (`Settings > Auto-merge sync conflicts (experimental)`), including deterministic canonical file selection and per-project conflict archival
- Field-level task conflict merge strategy for duplicate task IDs (`updatedAt` LWW + deduped union for assignees/tags/dependencies/subtaskIds)
- Task/project conflict merge test coverage and save-mode routing tests

### Changed

- Task-only updates now save with `taskOnly` mode to reduce unnecessary rewrites of the project note, lowering cross-device conflict pressure
- Project view now tracks canonicalized project paths after conflict normalization

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Setting "Save tasks on close" (default on). Turn off to make closing the task modal via X or click-outside discard edits, so only the Save button persists changes ([#62](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/62))
- "Open as note" button in the task modal header opens the task's underlying note in a new tab. Handy when the modal is too small to read the full description
- Paste a screenshot or drag any file onto the task modal description to save it under the vault's attachments folder and embed it as `![[...]]` at the cursor
- Search box, filters (status, priority, assignee, tag, due date, archived), and saved views now appear above every view, not just the table
- Filter state persists per project across plugin reloads
- Saved views remember the view mode they were created in; selecting one switches the project to that mode
- Gantt lifts a matching task to the top level when its parent is filtered out, so search and filters reveal deeply nested matches
- Release artifacts carry GitHub build provenance attestations; run `gh attestation verify <file> --owner StepanKropachev` to confirm a download was built from this repo
- Board view setting to show a plain-text task description preview on kanban cards (3-line clamp, default off)

### Changed

- UI follows the Obsidian theme: accent color, near/overdue colors, badge palette, and avatars all read from Obsidian CSS variables instead of the previous hardcoded purple
- Toolbar, gantt, filter, and bulk-action buttons render at native size (previously compact)
- Saved-view tabs share the soft accent treatment with filter pills (previously filled accent)
- `+ save view` and inline chip-list add buttons are native buttons (no longer dashed pills)
- Status and priority badges in the task modal are spans, no longer keyboard-focusable
- Confirm "Delete" uses Obsidian's native warning style
- Light-theme primary buttons use solid accent (`mod-cta`) instead of the bordered variant
- Project view header gear, bulk-action clear, chip remove, and table row icon buttons use lucide icons
- Chip remove buttons turn red on hover across tags, assignees, and dependencies
- Project-card and kanban-card progress bars are 3px tall
- The filter row collapses when no filters are active; click the `Filter` pill to expand
- Toggling a filter pill no longer steals focus from the search input
- Gantt milestone labels and dependency arrows now respect the active filter
- View switcher buttons are icon-only (previously icon + label)
- Assignee avatar initials combine the first letter of the first two words (e.g., "Michael Jordan" becomes "MJ" instead of "MI"), so people who share a first name don't collide as often
- New task files save as `<slug>.md` instead of `<slug>-<id>.md`. Existing files keep their current name until the title changes or you rename them yourself

### Removed

- The gantt "Hide completed" button. Use the Status filter to exclude `Done` and `Cancelled` instead; existing `ganttHideDone: true` settings are migrated automatically into each project's status filter
- The inline quick-add task input above the table. Use the toolbar `+ add task` button (which opens the task modal) instead

### Fixed

- Phantom 6px right margin on solo avatars (visible in the project edit modal)
- Kanban cards silently dropping the 4th+ assignee (now shown as `+N`)
- Duplicate task entries when creating a task
- Saved-view pill staying highlighted after the user diverged from its filter
- Garbled avatar initials when an assignee was stored as `[[Wiki Link]]`; initials, tooltip, and color now derive from the parsed display name ([#64](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/64))
- Renaming a task to a title that's already used by another file in the project now shows an inline error next to the title input

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-29

### Breaking Changes

- Clicking a project file no longer auto-opens the PM view. Bind the new "Open current file as project" command to a hotkey for the old behavior.

### Added

- Duplicate task action in the table and Kanban context menus
- "Open current file as project" command

### Fixed

- "Today" rolling over in the evening west of UTC
- Tab hijack when clicking a project from a task tab
- Duplicate tabs when opening a project
- Duplicate project list pane from the ribbon button
- Table scroll position not preserved across task modal open/close
- Project folder errors on case-insensitive vaults

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

- Dependency picker filters out cycles
